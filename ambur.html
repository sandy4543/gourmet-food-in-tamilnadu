        <h1>Ambur Biriyani</h1>
        <p>Ambur biryani is a delightful one-pot meal with succulent pieces of meat cooked to perfection along with the aromatic jeera samba rice, mint leaves, coriander leaves and whole spices. The flavor and taste of meat is more dominant in Ambur biryani than the other ones due to the fewer spices used.</p>
       <p>Ambur Biriyani grew to fame during the Nawab’s regime. The Biriynai has chicken, mutton and egg. Biriyani is famous for the taste and since then everybody loves the taste. </p>

        <p>This Ambur Chicken Biryani is a fantastic one-pot meal with juicy chicken cooked in special freshly ground spices along with the onion and tomato, along with the aromatic seeraga/jeeraga samba rice. The fresh hers are a crowning glory.  The flavor and taste of meat is more dominant in Ambur biryani than the other ones due to the fewer spices used. This is a biryani for spice lovers. The story of Ambur biryani can be traced back to the Mughal kitchens. The Nawabs of Arcot (established by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb) who ruled the Carnatic region of South India mainly in the 18th century used Arcot (near Ambur) as their base and it’s in these kitchens that the Ambur Biryani saga began</p>
        <p>Using whole chicken with bones is a must. The rice that we use in this particular style of biryani is also what makes it special. Jeeraga samba/seeraga samba rice is important. The freshly made biryani masala might feel like a stretch, but that one teaspoon of powder will make a huge difference. Cooking the chicken almost 70 percent before adding the rice is also a very important step to ensure the chicken is cooked through and is flavorful, this way, the chicken soaks up the spices and salt and lends to a juicy and flavorful final dish. Use fresh spices.</p>

            <li>Soaking the rice is an important step.</li>

            <li>Making the biryani masala, toasting it lightly is important.</li>
            
            <li>Grinding the red chilies along with ginger and garlic is important for this style of biryani. Frying them along with the oil is even more important. Cook on medium to low heat.</li>
            
           <li>The chicken should be cooked to almost 70%, along with spices. Once you add the rice, you can’t mix it. Add water and make sure to not touch it.</li>
            
            <li>Salting the rice correctly is important. It can be slightly, very slightly salty. Once it cooks, it will be perfect. If you undersalt the water, the final biryani will be less salty and you cannot do anything later. And it goes the other way too, too much salt and you’ll regret it.</li>
            
            <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, cooking it on dum is KEY. For Ambur Biryani, cook on dum.  Use a iron griddle or any other heavy bottomed flat griddle to cook on dum. Reduce the heat and let it cook through for 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>The most important part is to let it sit and settle before you serve it.</li></ul></p>
