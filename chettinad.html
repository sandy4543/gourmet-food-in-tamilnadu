        <h1>Chettinad Biriyani</h1>
        <p>Chettinad in Tamil Nadu was a strategic location for the spice trade. Its residents, the Chettiyars, prospered in the business of peppers and chillies with countries in Southeast Asia and the Arabs. Some food historians believe that biryani was introduced on the Malabar Coast by these Arab traders.</p>

Some food historians believe that biryani was introduced on the Malabar Coast by these Arab traders.</p>
        <p>The cuisine reflects the richness and diversity of spices available here, and Chettinad biryani encapsulates its many influences. Chicken is favoured over mutton because fowl meat is tastier in this region and lends itself well to the spices.</p>

        <p>Dry spices are hand ground and they follow the traditional dum-style of biryani preparation. Rice is combined with meat, seasoned with spices and allowed to cook on a slow fire in an Uruli, a traditional cooking pot in South India. The Uruli is covered and sealed with dough, allowing the meat to tenderise in its own juices while releasing the flavours to coat each grain. </p>
