        <h1>Chikkis</h1>
        <p>Chikki is a traditional Indian and Pakistani sweet generally made from nuts and jaggery/sugar. There are several different varieties of chikki in addition to the most common groundnut chikki.</p>
        <p>Each variety of chikki is named after the ingredients used, which include puffed or roasted Bengal gram, sesame, puffed rice, beaten rice, or khobra (desiccated coconut), and other nuts such as almonds, cashews and pistachios.</p>
        <p>Chikkis are made using a combination of ingredients. Special chikkis are made out of cashews, almonds, pistachios, and also sesame seed. Though jaggery is the usual sweetener material, sugar is sometimes used as the base. It is a very popular sweet item in both rural and urban South Asia. In the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, preparation often takes place with a larger proportion of nuts to jaggery. In several states, chikkis in both square and round forms are available.</p>
