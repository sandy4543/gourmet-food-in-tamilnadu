        <h1>Dindigul Biriyani</h1>
        <p>The Thalappakatti Biriyani Hotel’s roots can be traced all the way back to 1957. Founded by Mr. Nagasamy Naidu under the name Anandha Vilas Biriyani Hotel in Dindigul. He always wore a turban called THALAPA(a traditional head dress), which over the years became synonymous with his brand and cooking styles, leading him to earn the nick name “Thalappakatti Naidu” which would eventually became the name of our brand and restaurants.</p>
        <p>Right from the beginning, he always emphasized on taste and ensured that the Biriyani made at his hotel was both delicious and unique. This was achieved and still is by meticulous selection of ingredients prepared from quality masala products. Biriyani was prepared using superior quality Seeraga samba rice, known as Parakkum sittu and meat obtained from top-class breeds of cattle particularly found in the famous cattle-markets of Kannivadi and Paramathi.</p>

        <p><bold>Nagasamy Dhanabalan</bold> started out as a front-office receptionist in the UK eight years back. Today, he runs a Rs 200-crore business. The 35-year-old insists nothing was planned.</p>

        <p>Dindigul Thalappakatti Biryani is a popular South Indian dish, specifically from the city of Dindigul in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is known for its unique flavor and cooking style. The biryani is made using fragrant Basmati rice, tender pieces of meat (usually mutton or chicken), and a special blend of spices, including bay leaves, cloves, and cardamom. It is often served with raita (yogurt-based condiment) and a side of spicy gravy. The dish is named after the famous Thalappakatti biryani restaurant in Dindigul, which is renowned for its delicious biryani.</p>

        <p>A special blend of spices is used for the biryani. A type of short grain seeraga samba rice, called Parakkum Sittu and Kannivadi meat which comes from tender grass-fed goats makes the taste distinct. This rice, unlike basmati has no taste of its own, so it completely absorbs the flavours of the spices.</p>
