        <h1>Idly Sambar</h1>
        <p>Idli Sambar is a South Indian breakfast meal where soft fluffy steamed cakes known as idli are served with sambar, a vegetable lentil stew. Idli Sambar is made with lentils, plenty of spices, mixed vegetables and herbs.</p>
        <p>Kancheepuram is famous for its idlis which are not typically idly shaped. In addition, they also have cumin, ginger and pepper added to the batter to spice up the taste. The varieties found in Kancheepuram, gives idlis the exoctic touch. </p>
        <p>This is also one of the best tiffin sambar recipe. This hotel style sambar tasted damn good with soft and fluffy idlis. Oh yes, idli sambar and vada sambar are all time favorite at home. Not to forget our love for dosa too.</p>
        <p>In the South Indian cuisine there are many ways the sambar is made. I share one such variation which gives you a flavorful sambar like the one served in South Indian restaurants and hotels.</p>

        <p>Have seen in most of non-Konkani homes, idli is usually served with both sambar and chutney. But in Konkani homes(atleast in those which I have seen), it is served either with sambar or chutney. At my home, aayi would prepare both to keep the house calm. I liked sambar and my brother liked chutney, if one of these was not prepared, we would start fighting. </p>
        <p>Idli Sambar is a fluffy soft, melt in the mouth fermented and steamed breakfast, served with a delicious, piping hot lentil stew and topped with fresh coconut chutney. Not only is idli sambar a healthy breakfast, but also the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of proteins, and enriches the idli with vitamin B. Low in fat, sometimes its served with a dollop of ghee which is beneficial for healthy joints.</p>
