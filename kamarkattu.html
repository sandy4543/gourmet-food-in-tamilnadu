        <p>Kamarkattu is a traditional sweet snack that originates from the Tamil Nadu region in South India. It is made using ingredients like rice flour, jaggery (a type of unrefined sugar), grated coconut, cardamom powder, and ghee (clarified butter). The name "kamarkattu" translates to "sugar candy" in Tamil.</p>
        <p>Kamarkattu is popularly prepared and consumed during festivals and special occasions, especially during the Tamil festival of Pongal. It is also offered as a prasad (devotional offering) in temples. The sweet snack has a unique taste and texture, with a combination of sweetness from jaggery, aroma from cardamom, and a subtle crunch from the grated coconut.</p>
        <p>This one along with other candies were used to be available in small shops and especially in handcarts in the evening. It was also special on traditional occasions like Kovil Thiruvizha and other festivals. Though it had lost its spot in the urban shops a decade or so ago, it didn't lose its popularity. In the past few years it has slowly started acquiring the markets again along with other similar traditional snacks to reach back to its fans. It has also gained many new customers.</p>
