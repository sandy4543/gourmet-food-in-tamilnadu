        <h1>Karasev</h1>
        <p>Kara sev is a savoury snack from Sattur in the Virudunagar district of Tamil Nadu. It has been a popular all-time favourite since 1914. Like the Tirunelveli halwa and Kovilpatti chikkis, Sattur has become synonymous to kara sev.</p>
        <p>Sev is a popular snack in India with several regional variations, particularly for chaat snacks in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where it is eaten topped with sweetened boondi. The snack is also popular in Madhya Pradesh, especially in the cities of Indore, Ujjain and Ratlam, where many snack foods contain sev as a main ingredient.</p>
        <p>Made with rice flour, gram flour, a mixture of spices, refined Groundnut Oil, kara Sev is known for its spicy and savory flavour. Enjoy it as a crunchy snack on its own or as a topping for chaat or other savory dishes.</p>

        <p>Karasev, a popular deep fried snack prepared especially during festival seasons or diwali snacks. It is typically thick in texture and is mainly prepared with besan and rice flour dough with some jeera and black pepper. It is an ideal snack to share with friends and family especially when combined with diwali sweets.</p>
        <p>Unlike any other festival snacks recipes, karasev is an easy snacks recipe because it does not have any shape. Specifically, murukku or chakli needs patience and precision while preparing. but kara sev can be given any shape without much care.</p>

        <p>There are various forms of karasev recipes that are prepared in south indian cuisine. Each state of south india has its own variations with subtle changes to the ingredients. however the main variation is done with the proportions of besan or chickpea flour with rice flour. each flour dominance would result in a different colour and texture. by adding more quantity of rice flour you may have a crisp and whitish coloured kara sev recipe. whereas with more quantities of besan you may have strong yellowish colour with softer besan sev recipe. In addition some recipes may even add crushed garlic and can also be added for more flavor.</p>
        <p> Okkarai, I have fond memories associated with Kara Sev. Do you know which place is famous for Kara Sev in Tamil Nadu? Itâ€™s Sattur. I did undergrad in South TN, and I am fortunate to devour some of the traditional south TN delicacies.</p>
