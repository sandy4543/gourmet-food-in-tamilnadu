        <h1>Murukku</h1>
        <p>Muṟukku is a savoury, crunchy snack originating from the Indian subcontinent. The name muṟukku "twisting" refers to its shape. In India, murukku is especially common in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. It is called murkulu or janthukulu in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
        <p>Manapparai, a town in Tamil Nadu, is known for its unique variety of murukkus, known as Manapparai murukku. It is prepared with rice flour, sesame seeds, ajwain seeds, cumin seeds and asafoetida powder, which gives a flavour to this deep-fried snack.</p>
        <p>A snack that originated in Tamil Nadu, 'murukku' means 'to twist' in Tamil. It is made from semi-solid dough, which primarily consists of rice that's deep fried once it is passed through a murukku-maker.</p>

        <p>Murukku is a deep-fried snack that has its origins from the Indian subcontinent. Savoury and crunchy, the murukku is not only a favourite of the Indians, but also favoured by the Malays and Chinese alike.</p>
        <p>It is typically made from a semi-solid dough mixture comprising rice flour or ural dhal (black lentil) flour, salt, and spices. The murukku mixture is kneaded into a dough, which is shaped into spiral or coil shapes either by hand or extruded using a mould. The spirals are then deep fried in vegetable oil.</p>

        <p>The name ‘murukku’ is derived from the Tamil word for ‘twisted’, which refers to its shape. However, murukku does not only come in twisted spirals. It can be in the form of puffed pillows, sticks or ribbons – the last variety is sometimes known as ribbon pakoda.</p>
        <p>Murukkus bring back the chilhood nostalgia of attending weddings in hope of getting your hands on one of the biggest Kai Murruku. Large varieties of Kai Murukku are found in Tamil Nadu. But Manparrai, a small town in Tiruchi takes pride in getting the tag.</p>
