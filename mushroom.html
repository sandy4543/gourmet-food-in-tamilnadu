        <h1>Mushroom Biriyani</h1>
        <p>Mushroom biryani ( known as Kaalan Biryani in Tamil) is one of the delicacies of vegetarian cooking and this mushroom biryani recipe is one of my favorite recipes. Mushrooms are exotic ingredients of cooking, they have little flavor on their own but they will absorb the flavor of all the seasoning applied to them. Mushrooms are rich in nutrients and are a good source of anti oxidants while having lower calories</p>
        <p>Mushroom biryani is also known as Kalan Biryani in Tamil Nadu as mushrooms are called ‘kalan’ in Tamil language.</p>

        <p>Mushroom biryani is the classic vegetarian version of biryani with meaty mushrooms, tender fluffy rice and flavorful spices. I share two delectable mushroom biryani recipes from the South Indian cuisine. These recipes requires only one pot and are made in less than forty five minutes! A spicy, tasty mushroom and rice recipe, these vegetarian mushroom biryanis are perfect for a delicious weeknight meal.</p>
        <p>Mushrooms make a regular appearance in my family meals, as so many of my favorite recipes include these earthy ingredients. Below I share two recipes of Mushroom Biryani from the South Indian cuisine.</p>

        <p>These biryanis have a complex taste, flavor and are spicy. Usually, the South Indian version of biryani are one pot recipes and not cooked in layers and dum cooked, like the traditional Veg Biryani.</p>
        <p>This super delicious biryani has a tangy, bold and spicy flavor from the tomatoes, onions, herbs and spices. The recipe is vegan and gluten-free.</p>
        <p> Mushroom Biryani was then in the line with our regular Chicken Biryani and Mutton biryani to make the weekend smell special. Though I do not have her other mock-up recipes in hand today, I have her recipe for Mushroom Biryani with them.</p>
