        <h1>Mysore Pak</h1>
        <p>Mysore Pak was first prepared in the Royal Palace of Mysore, Karnataka, during the reign of King Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV in the 19th century. The royal chef, Kakasura Madappa, invented this sweet using besan (gram flour), sugar, and ghee. The king loved it so much that he named it after the city of Mysore.</p>
        <p>Mysore pak was first prepared in the kitchens of the Mysore Palace during the regime of Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, by a palace cook named Kakasura Madappa. Madappa made a concoction of gram flour, ghee and sugar. When asked its name, Madappa had nothing in mind, simply called it the Mysuru paka.</p>
        <p>Designed by the English Architect, Henry Irwin, the Mysore Palace dominates the skyline of Mysore. A three storied structure in the Indo-Saracenic style built between 1897-1912, the palace has beautifully designed square towers at cardinal points, covered with domes.</p>

        <p>Mysore Pak was first prepared in the Royal Palace of Mysore, Karnataka, during the reign of King Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV in the 19th century. The royal chef, Kakasura Madappa, invented this sweet using besan (gram flour), sugar, and ghee. The king loved it so much that he named it after the city of Mysore.</p>
        <p>Mysore Pak is made by mixing besan, sugar, and ghee in the right proportion and cooking it on low flame till it turns golden brown. The sweet is then cut into rectangle shape pieces and served. The key to the perfect Mysore Pak is the ratio of ingredients and the technique of cooking. A good Mysore Pak should be soft, porous, and melt in the mouth.</p>
        <p>Mysore Pak is not just a sweet, but an integral part of South Indian culture. It is a popular gift during festivals, weddings, and other celebrations. In some households, it is considered auspicious to make Mysore Pak on special occasions. Mysore Pak is also offered as prasad (offering) in temples.</p>

        <p>While Mysore Pak is high in calories due to the use of ghee and sugar, it also has some health benefits. Besan, the main ingredient in Mysore Pak, is a good source of protein and fiber. Ghee, when consumed in moderation, can improve digestion and boost immunity.</p>
        <p>Paaka shastra (short paka) in Kannada means ‘cooking procedure’ or ‘cooking techniques’. Also paka in Kannada refers to sticky sugar syrup obtained by simmering sugar with equal amount of water; specifically for Mysore pak, the simple syrup is heated to the soft ball stage. The syrup is used as the primary sweetening agent in various Indian sweet dishes like Jalebi, Badam puri, Mysore pak and others. The syrup is flavored with various spice essences like cardamom, rose, honey etc. Paka syrup preparation is a skilled art mastered by few cooks, some of whom keep their methods secret.</p>
        <p>Mysore pak is an Indian sweet prepared in ghee. It originated in the city of Mysore, one of the major cities in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is made of generous amounts of ghee, sugar, gram flour, and often cardamom.</p>
