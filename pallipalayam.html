        <p>Most of the Kongu belt is arid in nature and food especially meat was scarce and reserved only for special occasions. Chicken Pallipalayam is a simple dish made with meat, copious amounts of shallots, red chillies and coconut that is added to the dish as small bits. There is an interesting history as to why coconut is added as bits. </p>
        <p> Since the region is very arid and not rich,the food was always a simple fare with whatever could grow. Meat was consumed rarely. Coconut bits are used in the dish to increase the volume of the dish along with the meat. Since coconut is meaty, it would give the same textural bite as meat.</p>
