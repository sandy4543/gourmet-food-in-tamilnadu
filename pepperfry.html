        <p>Chicken Pepper Fry can have many flavor variations depending on the region where it's prepared. Primarily you'll find it in the south of India, where pepper is the king of spices. This version is from Kerala, a state where the pepper vine veils walls and roofs, and finds its way into almost every meal.</p>
        <p>The oil is the key to the flavor of the dish because the spices infuse into it and coat and fry each piece of chicken until the flavor of the pepper and other aromatics goes into the meat. The onions and tomato give the dish some body and add thickness to the gravy. You can reduce the amount of pepper if your spice threshold is low, but I'd recommend that you don't go too low.The oil is the key to the flavor of the dish because the spices infuse into it and coat and fry each piece of chicken until the flavor of the pepper and other aromatics goes into the meat.
