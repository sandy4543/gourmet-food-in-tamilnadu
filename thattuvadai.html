        <h1>Thattu Vadai Set</h1>
        <p>It is said that the dish got its popularity from Yercaud, a popular hill station in the district. There was a local merchant named Balakrishnan who started selling thattu vadais and murruku to visitors. Gradually, he started adding innovation to the dish.</p>
        <p> Sometimes it was homemade tomato chutney while other time it was a salad made with seasonal vegetables. Slowly the dish gained popularity in other cities and hill stations. Every vendor used to make their own versions and soon it became popular across the district.</p>
        <p>The dish with a hint of both chilly and sweet chutneys is only available between 4 pm and 10 pm. The thattu vadai set is priced between Rs 10 and 20.</p>

        <p>We Indians love our spicy, tangy and flavorful street foods so much, there are whole streets dedicated to just street food with trucks, carts and even vendors with just a small basket doling out all the flavors of chaats and savory snacks like samosas, aloo tikkis, Pani Puri, Bhel, deep fried snacks made of raw plantain or even chole bhature!</p>

        <p>Salem Thattu Vadai set or sandwich is one such street food local to Salem. Although I am from this small town, I was not fortunate enough to try these during my school or college days as we never preferred to eat from any street food cart or any roadside snack, mainly for hygienic reasons.</p>
