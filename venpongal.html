        <h1>Ven Pongal</h1>
        <p>Ven Pongal is a traditional South Indian dish made with rice, split yellow mung dal, ghee, cumin, ginger, pepper and curry leaves. The word “Venn” means “White” in Tamil and “Pongal” means “to bubble & overflow” which signifies abundance. It also refers to this rice lentil dish.</p>

        <p>Ven Pongal is a classic breakfast dish in South India, especially in Tamil Nadu. This with medu vada is a common menu for breakfast in restaurants. It is very filling and can also be a lunch or dinner item as well.</p>
        <p>Ven Pongal and gothsu is such a classic combination. Weekends are meant to relax, but with young kids, our weekends are crazier than the weekdays. Most of the weekends, we skip breakfast and have an early lunch. This is one of the comforting brunches that I make often as it is very filling and perfect to keep us going for the whole day.</p>
